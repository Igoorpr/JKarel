## About

JKAREL

Developed in 2018 for an academic project, these files are simple and contain JAVA code.

This program was compiled using JGrasp.

I have provided three example files in which the robot can move, collect markers from the indicated positions, and unload all collected markers at a predefined location. 
The robot should then enter through the door, return to its starting position, and exit through the same door.
